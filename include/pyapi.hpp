 * of the resulting path (Npath), 2) a pointer to the structure holding
 * all the required information (struct_ptr), and 3) the number of cuts (Ncut).

 * by a call to save_grid_lines, which transfers the path contained in
 * struct_ptr and frees the allocated space.
 * It then has to be followed by a call to clean_grid_lines_struct. If this
 * last call is omitted, a memory leak will occur. If this is called a second
